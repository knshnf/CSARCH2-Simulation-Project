# CSARCH2 Simulation Project 2324T3-S12-G01
## Overview
This simulation project performs IEEE-754 binary-32 floating point addition. It accepts two operands in binary and base-2, along with the choice of rounding method and the number of digits supported. The process involves adding the two operands and providing step-by-step operation details, including initial normalization, the operation, post-operation normalization, and the final answer. Additionally, users have the option to output the results into a text file for further analysis or documentation.
